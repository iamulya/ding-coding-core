**PACT** was a series of [compilers][0] for the [IBM 701][1] and [IBM 704][2] scientific computers. Their development was conducted jointly by IBM and a committee of customers starting in 1954\. **PACT I** was developed for the 701, and **PACT IA** for the 704\. The emphasis in that early generation of compilers was minimization of the [memory footprint][3], because memory was a very expensive resource at the time.[\[1\]][4] The word "compiler" was not in widespread use at the time, so most of the 1956 papers described it as an "(automatic) coding system",[\[2\]][5][\[3\]][6] although the word compiler was also used in some papers.[\[4\]][7][\[5\]][8]
