**M2001** is a [modular][0] [educational][1] mathematical [programming language][2] for developing and presenting mathematical algorithms, from the modern discrete to the classical continuous mathematics. M2001 is built on a semantic framework that is based in [category theory][3] and has a syntax similar to that of [Pascal][4] or [Modula-2][5].

It is designed purely for pedagogic use, so efficiency and ease of implementation have been far less important in its development than generality and range of application. It was created to play an important role in forming a formal algorithmic foundation for first-year college math students.

## Overview

Based on a multi-layered datatyping scheme, M2001 includes a collection of eight _computational types_ and another of six _structured types_. Over these two, respectively, collections of _mathematical classes_ and of _abstract classes_ have been built, the latter encompassing the most commonly used [abstract data types][6] in [computer science][7]:

The lower two layers of M2001's typing scheme were based on the earlier experimental called [CAT programming language][8].
