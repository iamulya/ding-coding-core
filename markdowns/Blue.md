**Blue** is a system for teaching [object-oriented programming][0], developed at the [University of Sydney][1], Australia. It is an [integrated development environment][2] (IDE) and a [programming language][3]. Blue has been used for teaching since 1997\. The development was stopped in 1999 when one of its principals, [Michael Kölling][4], began applying the IDE design to the [Java][5] programming language, resulting in [BlueJ][6].

The **Blue** language syntax is derived from the [Eiffel programming language][7] and one of the most useful developments for instruction was the [integrated development environment][2] which was designed with learning [object-oriented programming][0] in mind. The Blue IDE visually shows the reference and inheritance relationships between classes. At run time it allows the developer to visually and interactively create instances of any class, inspect the instance, and invoke functions on those classes.

Many of the language features it has inherited from Eiffel make it suitable for teaching, such as design by contract (pre-conditions, post-conditions, class invariants) and automatic garbage collection.

The team that developed Blue has continued on with a very similar [integrated development environment][2] called [BlueJ][6] which uses the [Java programming language][5] and has similar goals. The [BlueJ][6] project is under active development.
