**COMAL** (_Common Algorithmic Language_) is a computer [programming language][0] developed in [Denmark][1] by [Benedict Løfstedt][2] and [Børge R. Christensen][3] in 1973\.

The "COMAL 80 PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE REPORT" contains the formal definition of the language.

## Design

COMAL was created as a mixture of the prevalent educational programming languages of the time, [BASIC][4], [Pascal][5], and, at least in the Commodore and Compis versions, the "[turtle graphics][6]" of [Logo][7]. The language was meant to introduce [structured programming][8] elements in an environment where BASIC would normally be used.

## History

In the early 1980s, [Apple Computer][9] won a contract to supply [Apple II][10] computers running [CP/M][11] and COMAL to Irish secondary schools.

In 1984 [Acornsoft][12] released a COMAL implementation, by Paul Christensen and Roy Thorton, for their 8-bit BBC Micro and Acorn Electron computers.[\[1\]][13]

Between 1984-1987 TeleNova, a subsidiary of the industrial arm of the Swedish Telecoms system, Teli industrier manufactured a desktop PC called "Compis" for the educational sector. An enhanced version of COMAL was supplied as the standard programming language for this PC. Versions were created for both CP/M86 and MS-DOS. The latter version is available for Windows XP. The (Swedish) reference manual is [ISBN 91-24-40022-X][14]

In 1990 Thomas Lundy and Rory O'Sullivan produced the definitive text on COMAL Programming.\[_[citation needed][15]_\] They matched and compared COMAL with [BBC Structured Basic][16].

As of 2016 COMAL is still actively in use as an educational programming language. Some high schools in the United Kingdom continue to use it to teach the subject of Computing.
