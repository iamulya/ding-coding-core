**Amiga E**, or very often simply **E**, is a [programming language][0] created by Wouter van Oortmerssen on the [Amiga][1]. He has since moved on to develop the [SHEEP programming language][2] for the new [AmigaDE platform][3] and the CryScript language (also known as DOG) used during the development of the [video game][4] [Far Cry][5].

Amiga E is a combination of many features from a number of languages, but follows the original [C programming language][6] most closely in terms of basic concepts. Amiga E's main benefits are fast compilation (allowing it to be used in place of a scripting language), very readable source code, flexible type system, powerful module system, exception handling (not C++ variant) and [Object oriented programming][7].

A ["hello world" program][8] in Amiga E looks like:

Amiga E was used to create the core of the popular Amiga graphics software [Photogenics][9].

## Implementations

## _Amiga E_, by Wouter van Oortmerssen.

The first compiler, written in M68k assembler. Support tools written in E. Generates M68000 machine code directly.

## _CreativE_, by Tomasz Wiszkowski.

Based on the GPL sources of Amiga E and adds many extensions to the compiler.

## _PowerD_, by Martin Kuchinka.

Based on the AmigaE language, but not compatible with it due to changes in syntax.

## _YAEC_, by Leif Salomonsson.

Written from scratch in E. Uses external assembler and linker.

## _ECX_, by Leif Salomonsson.

A compiler and tools written from scratch in E, can compile itself, supports multiple targets and adds many extensions.

## _RE_, by Marco Antoniazzi.

Based on the AmigaE language, but not fully compatible, with some changes in syntax and additions, inspired by PowerD.

## _PortablE_, by Christopher Handley.

A meta-compiler written from scratch in E, can compile itself, supports multiple targets.
