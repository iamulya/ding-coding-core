**COWSEL** (_COntrolled Working SpacE Language_) is a [programming language][0] designed between 1964 and 1966 by [Robin Popplestone][1]. It was based on an [RPN][2] form of [Lisp][3] combined with some ideas from [CPL][4].

COWSEL was initially implemented on a [Ferranti Pegasus][5] computer at the [University of Leeds][6] and on a [Stantec Zebra][7] at the [Bradford Institute of Technology][8]; later, [Rod Burstall][9] implemented it on an [Elliot 4120][10] at the [University of Edinburgh][11].

COWSEL was renamed **POP-1** during the summer of 1966 and development continued under that name from then on.

## Example code

Note that keywords were also underlined in the original printouts. Popplestone used a [Flexowriter][12] with underscoring for [syntax highlighting][13].
