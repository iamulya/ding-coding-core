**Speedcoding** or **Speedcode** was the first [high order][0] or high-level language created for an [IBM][1] computer.[\[1\]][2] The language was developed by [John Backus][3] in 1953 for the [IBM 701][4] to support computation with [floating point numbers][5].[\[2\]][6] Here high level means symbolic and aiming for [natural language][7] expressivity as a goal as opposed to [machine][8] or hardware instruction oriented coding.

The idea arose from the difficulty of programming the [IBM SSEC][9] machine when Backus was hired to calculate astronomical positions in early 1950\.[\[3\]][10] The speedcoding system was an interpreter and focused on ease of use at the expense of system resources. It provided pseudo-instructions for common mathematical functions: logarithms, exponentiation, and trigonometric operations. The resident software analyzed pseudo-instructions one by one and called the appropriate subroutine. Speedcoding was also the first implementation of decimal input/output operations. Although it substantially reduced the effort of writing many jobs, the running time of a program that was written with the help of Speedcoding was usually ten to twenty times that of machine code.[\[4\]][11] The interpreter took 310 memory words, about 30% of the memory available on a 701\.[\[1\]][2]
