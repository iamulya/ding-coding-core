**FLOW-MATIC**, originally known as _B-0_ (_Business Language version 0_), was the first English-like [data processing][0] language. It was developed for the [UNIVAC I][1] at [Remington Rand][2] under [Grace Hopper][3] during the period from 1955 until 1959\. It had a strong influence on the development of [COBOL][4].

## Development

Hopper had found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation.[\[2\]][5] In late 1953 she proposed that data processing problems should be expressed using English keywords, but Rand management considered the idea unfeasible. In early 1955, she and her team wrote a specification for such a programming language and implemented a prototype.[\[3\]][6] The FLOW-MATIC compiler became publicly available in early 1958 and was substantially complete in 1959\.[\[4\]][7]

## Innovations and influence

First, FLOW-MATIC was the first programming language to [express operations using English-like statements][8].[\[4\]][7]

Second, FLOW-MATIC was the first system to distinctly separate the description of data from the operations on it. Its [data definition language][9], unlike its executable statements, was not English-like; rather, data structures were defined by filling in pre-printed forms.[\[4\]][7]

Flow-Matic was a major influence in the design of [COBOL][4], since only it and its direct descendent [AIMACO][10] were in actual use at the time.[\[5\]][11] Several elements of Flow-Matic were incorporated into COBOL:

## Sample program

A sample FLOW-MATIC program:[\[6\]][12][\[7\]][13]

Note that this sample includes only the executable statements of the program, the `COMPILER` section. The record fields `PRODUCT-NO` and `UNIT-PRICE` would have been defined in the `DIRECTORY` section, which did not use English-like syntax.[\[8\]][14]
