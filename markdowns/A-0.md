The **A-0 system** (_Arithmetic Language version 0_), written by [Grace Hopper][0] in 1951 and 1952 for the [UNIVAC I][1], was the first [compiler][2] ever developed for an electronic computer.[\[1\]][3] The A-0 functioned more as a [loader][4] or [linker][5] than the modern notion of a compiler. A program was specified as a sequence of subroutines and arguments. The subroutines were identified by a numeric code and the arguments to the subroutines were written directly after each subroutine code. The A-0 system converted the specification into [machine code][6] that could be fed into the computer a second time to execute the said program.

The A-0 system was followed by the A-1, A-2, A-3 (released as [ARITH-MATIC][7]), AT-3 (released as [MATH-MATIC][8]) and B-0 (released as [FLOW-MATIC][9]).

The A-2 system was developed at the [UNIVAC division of Remington Rand][10] in 1953 and released to customers by the end of that year.[\[2\]][11] Customers were provided the source code for A-2 and invited to send their improvements back to UNIVAC. Thus A-2 was an early, and perhaps the first, example of [free and open-source software][12].[\[3\]][13]
