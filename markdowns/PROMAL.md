**PROMAL** (**PROgrammer's Microapplication Language**) is a [structured programming][0] language from [Systems Management Associates][1] for [MS-DOS][2], [Commodore 64][3], and [Apple II][4]. PROMAL features simple syntax, no line numbers, long variable names, functions and procedures with argument passing, real number type, arrays, strings, pointer, and a built-in I/O library. Like [ABC][5] and [Python][6], indentation is part of the language syntax.

The language uses a single-pass compiler to generate byte code that is interpreted when the program is run. Since the memory is very limited on these early home computers, the compiler can compile to/from disk and memory. The software package for C64 includes a full-screen editor and command shell.

## Reception

_[Ahoy!][7]_ called PROMAL for the Commodore 64 "one of the best" structured languages. It concluded "As an introduction to structured programming languages and as an alternative to BASIC, PROMAL is well worth the time needed to learn it and the $49.95 to purchase it".[\[1\]][8]
