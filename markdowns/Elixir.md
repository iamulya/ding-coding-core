**Elixir** is a [functional][0], [concurrent][1], general-purpose [programming language][2] that runs on the [Erlang][3] [virtual machine][4] (BEAM). Elixir builds on top of Erlang and shares the same abstractions for building distributed, fault-tolerant applications. Elixir also provides a productive tooling and an extensible design. The latter is supported by compile-time [metaprogramming][5] with [macros][6] and [polymorphism][7] via protocols.[\[4\]][8]

Elixir is successfully used in the industry by companies such as [Pinterest][9][\[5\]][10] and [Moz][11].[\[6\]][12] Elixir is also used for web development, by companies such as Bleacher Report and Inverse,[\[7\]][13] and for building embedded-systems.[\[8\]][14][\[9\]][15] The community organizes yearly events in both United States[\[10\]][16][\[11\]][17][\[12\]][18] and Europe[\[13\]][19] as well as minor local events and conferences.[\[14\]][20][\[15\]][21]

## History

Jos√© Valim is the creator of the Elixir programming language, an R&D project of [Plataformatec][22]. His goals were to enable higher extensibility and productivity in the Erlang VM while keeping compatibility with Erlang's ecosystem.[\[16\]][23]

## Features

## Examples

The following examples can be run in an iex shell or saved in a file and run from the command line by typing `elixir _<filename>_`.

Classic [Hello world][24] example:

Comprehensions

Pattern Matching

Modules
