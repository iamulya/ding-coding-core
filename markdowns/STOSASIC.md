**STOS BASIC** is a dialect of the [BASIC][0] [programming language][1] implemented on the [Atari ST][2] computer. STOS BASIC was originally developed by _[Jawx][3]_, [François Lionet][4], and [Constantin Sotiropoulos][5] and published by [Mandarin Software][6] (now known as [Europress Software][7]).

_STOS Basic_ was a version of [BASIC][0] that was designed for creating games, but the set of powerful high-level graphics and sound commands it offered made it suitable for developing multimedia-intense software without any knowledge of the internals of the [Atari ST][2].

## History

Although the first version of _STOS_ to be released in the [UK][8] (version 2.3) was released in late 1988 by [Mandarin Software][6], a version had been released earlier in [France][9].

Version 2.3 was bundled with three complete games (_Orbit_, _Zoltar_ and _Bullet Train_), and many accessories and utilities (such as sprite and music editors). A [compiler][10] was soon released that enabled the user to compile the _STOS Basic_ program into an executable file that ran a lot faster because it was [compiled][10] rather than [interpreted][11]. In order to be compatible with the compiler, STOS needed to be upgraded to version 2.4 (which came with the compiler). STOS 2.4 also fixed a few bugs and had faster floating point mathematics code, but the floating point numbers had a smaller range.

STOS 2.5 was released to make STOS run on Atari STEs with TOS 1.06 (1.6), and then STOS 2.6 was needed to make STOS run on Atari STEs with TOS 1.62\. STOS 2.7 was a compiler-only upgrade that made programs with the STOS tracker extension (used to play MOD music) compile.

There was a 3rd-party hack called STOS 2.07 designed to make _STOS_ run on even more TOS versions, and behave on the [Atari Falcon][12].

## Extensions

It was possible to extend the functionality of _STOS_ by adding extensions which added more commands to the language and increased the functionality. The first such extension to be released was _STOS Maestro_ which added the ability to play sampled sounds. _STOS Maestro plus_ was _STOS Maestro_ bundled with a sound-sampler cartridge. Other extensions included _TOME_, _STOS 3D_, _STE extension_, _Misty_, _The Missing Link_, _Control extension_, _Extra_ and _Ninja Tracker_. These extensions kept _STOS_ alive for many years after its release.

## Criticisms

While giving programmers the ability to rapidly create a game without knowing the internals, _STOS_ was criticised for being slow (especially when intensively using the non-high-level commands), and for not allowing the user to program in a structured manner.

## Other platforms

In 1990, [AMOS BASIC][13] was released for the [Amiga][14]. It was originally meant to shortly follow the release of _STOS_ on the [Atari ST][2]. [AMOS][13] was released about two years after the [UK][8] release of _STOS_. But this turned out to be a blessing in disguise for the [Amiga][14] community thanks to the extra development time. Not only did [AMOS][13] take advantage of the extra [Amiga][14] hardware and have more commands than _STOS_, but the style of [BASIC][0] was completely different - it had no line-numbers, and there were many [structured programming][15] constructs (at one time, the _STOS Club Newsletter_ published a program that allowed the reader to program _STOS_ using that style). While it was often possible to directly convert _STOS BASIC_ programs that did not heavily rely on extensions to [AMOS BASIC][13], the reverse was not usually true.

A [PC][16] version called _PCOS_ was once mentioned, but that never materialised. Instead, the publishers [Mandarin Software][6] renamed themselves [Europress Software][7]. One of the developers in [Jawx][3], [Francois Lionet][17], was later to form [Clickteam][18] with [Yves Lamoureux][19] and went on to release the [Klik][20] (click) series of games-creation tools (which were dissimilar to _STOS_ as they use a primarily mouse-driven interface without the need for traditional code). [Klik & Play][21], [The Games Factory][22], [Multimedia Fusion][23] and [Multimedia Fusion 2][24] have been released in this series.
