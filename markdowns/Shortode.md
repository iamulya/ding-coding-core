**Short Code** was one of the first higher-level languages ever developed for an [electronic computer][0].[\[1\]][1] Unlike [machine code][2], Short Code statements represented mathematic expressions rather than a machine instruction. Also known as an automatic programming, the source code was not compiled but executed through an interpreter to simplify the programming process; the execution time was much slower though.[\[2\]][3]

## History

Short Code was proposed by [John Mauchly][4] in 1949 and originally known as Brief Code. William Schmitt implemented a version of Brief Code in 1949 for the [BINAC][5] computer, though it was never debugged and tested. The following year Schmitt implemented a new version of Brief Code for the [UNIVAC I][6] where it was now known as Short Code (also Short Order Code). A revised version of Short Code was developed in 1952 for the Univac II by A. B. Tonik and J. R Logan.[\[3\]][7]

While Short Code represented expressions, the representation itself was not direct and required a process of manual conversion. Elements of an expression were represented by two-character codes and then divided into 6-code groups in order to conform to the 12 byte words used by BINAC and Univac computers.[\[4\]][8] For example, the expression:

was converted to Short Code by a sequence of substitutions and a final regrouping:

Along with basic [arithmetic][9], Short Code allowed for branching and calls to a library of functions. The language was [interpreted][10] and ran about 50 times slower than [machine code][2].[\[5\]][11]
