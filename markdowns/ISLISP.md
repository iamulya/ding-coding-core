**ISLISP** (also capitalized as **ISLisp**) is a [programming language][0] in the [LISP][1] family standardized by [ISO][2] working group ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/WG 16[\[1\]][3] (commonly referred to simply as SC22/WG16 or WG16). The primary output of this working group was an International Standard, [ISO/IEC 13816:1997(E)][4], published by ISO. The standard was updated in 2007 and republished as [ISO/IEC 13816:2007(E)][5].[\[2\]][6] Although official publication was through ISO, versions of the ISLISP language specification are available that are believed to be in the [public domain][7].[\[3\]][8]

The goal of this standardization effort was to define a small, core language to help bridge the gap between differing dialects of Lisp. It attempted to accomplish this goal by studying primarily [Common Lisp][9], [EuLisp][10], [Le Lisp][11], and [Scheme][12] and standardizing only those features shared between them.

From [ISLISP.info][13]:

ISLISP has these design goals:

ISLISP has separate function and value namespaces (hence it is a Lisp2).

ISLISP's object system, ILOS, is for the most part a subset of [CLOS][14].
