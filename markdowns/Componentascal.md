**Component Pascal** is a [programming language][0] in the tradition of [Niklaus Wirth][1]'s [Pascal][2],[\[1\]][3] [Modula-2][4],[\[2\]][5] [Oberon][6][\[3\]][7][\[4\]][8] and [Oberon-2][9].[\[5\]][10] It bears the name of the [Pascal programming language][2] but is incompatible with it. Instead, it is a minor variant and refinement of Oberon-2, designed and supported by a small [ETH Zürich][11] spin-off company called Oberon microsystems. They developed an IDE ([Integrated development environment][12]) called [BlackBox Component Builder][13]. At the time the first version was released (1994 as _Oberon/F_) it presented a novel approach to [graphical user interface][14] (GUI) construction based on editable forms, where fields and command buttons are linked to exported variables and executable procedures. This approach bears some similarity to the [code-behind][15] way used in Microsoft's [.NET][16] 3.0 to access code in [XAML][17], which was released in 2008\.

An [open-source][18] implementation exists for the [.NET][19] and [Java Virtual Machine][20] platforms, from the Gardens Point team around John Gough at [Queensland University of Technology][21] in Australia.

On 23 June 2004 Oberon microsystems announced that the BlackBox Component Builder was made available as a free download and that an open-source version was planned. The beta open-source version was initially released in December, 2004 and updated to a final v1.5 release in December, 2005\. It includes the complete source code of the IDE, compiler, debugger, source analyser, profiler and interfacing libraries and can also be downloaded from their website. Several release candidates for v1.6 appeared in the years 2009 -- 2011, the latest one (1.6rc6) appeared on Oberon microsystems web pages in 2011\. End of 2013 Oberon Microsystems released the final release 1.6\. It is most probably last release bundled by Oberon Microsystems and a [small community][22] took over the ongoing development.

BlackBox Component Pascal uses the extensions .odc (_= **O**beron **d**o**c**ument_) for document files, such as source files for example, and .osf (_= **O**beron **s**ymbol **f**ile_) for symbol files while Gardens Point Component Pascal uses .cp for source and .cps for symbol files. BlackBox Component Pascal has its own executable and loadable object format .ocf (_= **O**beron **c**ode **f**ile_); it includes a runtime linking loader for this format. The document format (.odc) is a rich text binary format, which allows nice formatting, supports conditional folding, and allows active content to be embedded in the source text. It also handles user interface elements in editable forms. This is in tradition of the Oberon Text format.[\[6\]][23]

## Syntax

The full syntax for CP, as given by the Language Report, is shown below. Note that in the [extended Backus--Naur form][24] only 34 grammatical productions are required, just one more than for [Oberon-2][25], although it is a rather more advanced language.
