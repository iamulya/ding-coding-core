The **Polymorphic Programming Language** (**PPL**) was developed in 1969 at [Harvard University][0] by [Thomas A. Standish][1]. It is an [interactive][2], [extensible][3] language with a [base language][4] similar to [APL][5].

The '<-' (or '←') [assignment][6] operator has played an influence in the [S programming language][7].[\[1\]][8]
