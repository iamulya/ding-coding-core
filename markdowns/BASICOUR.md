The computers ran an operating system with the BASIC interpreter integrated.

In 1988, Wall Street financier [Bennett S. LeBow][6], who had acquired a [controlling interest][7] in the company, used it as a platform for an unsuccessful attempted [hostile takeover][8] of much larger [Prime Computer][9].[\[1\]][10]

The Basic4 system was utilized by many small banks and credit unions.
