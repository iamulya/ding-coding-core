**MARK IV** is a [Fourth-generation programming language][0] that was created by [Informatics, Inc.][1] (later, [Sterling Software][2]) in the 1960s. [Informatics, Inc.][2] took advantage of IBM's decision to [unbundle their software][3]; MARK IV was the first "software product to have cumulative sales of $10 million".

MARK IV was developed for IBM Systems (360 and 370) and for the [RCA Spectra 70][4]. Its main benefit was allowing faster application development on the order of 6 to 10 times faster than doing a system using a 3GL, such as [COBOL][5]. MARK IV, being an early 4GL, allowed user development of systems related to business. In an 1971 ad by Informatics, there are several quotes from customers, such as:

MARK IV (as VISION:BUILDER)[\[2\]][6] is now part of the product suite from [Computer Associates][7].[\[3\]][8]
