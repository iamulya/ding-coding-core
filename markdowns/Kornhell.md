**KornShell** (**ksh**) is a [Unix shell][0] which was developed by [David Korn][1] at [Bell Labs][2] in the early 1980s and announced at [USENIX][3] on July 14, 1983\.[\[1\]][4][\[2\]][5] The initial development was based on [Bourne shell][6] source code.[\[7\]][7] Other early contributors were Bell Labs developers Mike Veach and Pat Sullivan, who wrote the [Emacs][8]- and [vi][9]-style line editing modes' code, respectively.[\[8\]][10] KornShell is backward-compatible with the [Bourne shell][6] and includes many features of the [C shell][11], inspired by the requests of Bell Labs users.

## Design

KornShell complies with [POSIX.2][12], Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992.) Major differences between KornShell and the traditional Bourne shell include:

## History

KornShell was originally [proprietary software][13]. In 2000 the source code was released under a license particular to AT&T, but since the 93q release in early 2005 it has been licensed under the [Eclipse Public License][14].[\[4\]][15] KornShell is available as part of the AT&T Software Technology (AST) Open Source Software Collection. As KornShell was initially only available through a proprietary license from AT&T, a number of free and open source alternatives were created. These include pdksh, mksh, [GNU][16] [bash][17], and [zsh][18].

The functionality of the original KornShell, ksh88, was used as a basis for the standard [POSIX.2][12], Shell and Utilities, Command Interpreter (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992.)

Some vendors still ship their own versions of the older ksh88 variant, sometimes with extensions. ksh93 is still maintained by its author. Releases of ksh93 are versioned by appending a letter to the name; the current version\[_[when?][19]_\] is ksh93u, following ksh93t+ (which followed ksh93t); ksh93v is in the beta phase.\[_[when?][19]_\][\[10\]][20]

As "Desktop KornShell" (dtksh), ksh93 is distributed as part of the [Common Desktop Environment][21].[\[11\]][22] This version also provides shell-level mappings for [Motif][23] widgets. It was intended as competitor to [Tcl][24]/[Tk][25].[\[12\]][26]

The original KornShell, ksh88, became the default shell on [AIX][27] in version 4,[\[13\]][28][\[14\]][29] with ksh93 being available separately.[\[15\]][30]

[UnixWare][31] 7 includes both ksh88 and ksh93. The default Korn shell is ksh93, which is supplied as /usr/bin/ksh, and the older version is available as /usr/bin/ksh88.[\[16\]][32] UnixWare also includes dtksh when [CDE][21] is installed.
