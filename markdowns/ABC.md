**ABC** is an imperative general-purpose [programming language][0] and [programming environment][1] developed at [CWI][2], [Netherlands][3] by [Leo Geurts][4], [Lambert Meertens][5], and [Steven Pemberton][6]. It is interactive, structured, high-level, and intended to be used instead of [BASIC][7], [Pascal][8], or [AWK][9]. It is not meant to be a systems-programming language but is intended for teaching or prototyping.

The language had a major influence on the design of the [Python programming language][10] (as a counterexample); [Guido van Rossum][11], who developed Python, previously worked for several years on the ABC system in the early 1980s.[\[2\]][12][\[3\]][13]

## Features

Its designers claim that ABC programs are typically around a quarter the size of the equivalent Pascal or [C][14] programs, and more readable. Key features include:

ABC was originally a monolithic implementation, leading to an inability to adapt to new requirements, such as creating a [graphical user interface][15]. ABC could not directly access the underlying file system and operating system.

The full ABC system includes a programming environment with [syntax-directed editing][16], suggestions, [persistent variables][17], and multiple workspaces - and is available as an [interpreter][18]/[compiler][19], currently at version 1.05.02, and ported to [Unix][20], [DOS][21], [Atari][22], and [Apple Macintosh][23].
