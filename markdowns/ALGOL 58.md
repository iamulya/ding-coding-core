**ALGOL 58**, originally known as **IAL**, is one of the family of [ALGOL][0] computer [programming languages][1]. It was an early compromise design soon superseded by [ALGOL 60][2]. According to [John Backus][3][\[2\]][4]

"The Zurich ACM-GAMM Conference had two principal motives in proposing the IAL: (a) To provide a means of communicating numerical methods and other procedures between people, and (b) To provide a means of realizing a stated process on a variety of machines..."

ALGOL 58 introduced the fundamental notion of the compound statement, but it was restricted to control flow only, and it was not tied to identifier scope in the way that Algol 60's [blocks][5] were.

## Name

Bauer attributes the name to Bottenbruch: "He \[Bottenbruch\] was also the man who coined at that time \[1957\] the word 'algorithmic language' (algorithmische Sprache) at least in Germany."[\[3\]][6]

## History

There were proposals for a universal language by the [Association for Computing Machinery][7] (ACM) and also by the [GAMM][8]. It was decided to organize a joint meeting to combine them. The meeting took place from May 27 to June 2, 1958, at [ETH Zurich][9] and was attended by the following people:

The language was originally proposed to be called **IAL** (**International Algebraic Language**) but according to Perlis[\[4\]][10] this was rejected as an "'unspeakable' and pompous acronym". ALGOL was suggested instead, though not officially adopted until a year later. The publication following the meeting still used the name IAL.[\[5\]][11] Unresolved disagreements also led to a plan to define two dialects, ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 60\[_[citation needed][12]_\] but the name ALGOL 60 was eventually used for a specific language .[\[6\]][13]

By the end of 1958 the ZMMD-group had built a working ALGOL 58 compiler for the [Z22][14] computer. ZMMD was an abbreviation for Zürich (where Rutishauser worked), München (workplace of Bauer and Samelson), Mainz (location of the Z22 computer), Darmstadt (workplace of Bottenbruch).

ALGOL 58 saw some implementation effort at [IBM][15], but the effort was in competition with [FORTRAN][16], and soon abandoned. It was also implemented at [Dartmouth College][17] on an [LGP-30][18], but that implementation soon evolved into [Algol 60][19]. An implementation for the [Burroughs][20] 220 called [BALGOL][21] evolved along its own lines as well, but retained much of ALGOL 58's original character.[\[7\]][22]

ALGOL 58's primary contribution was to later languages; it was used as a basis for [JOVIAL][23], [MAD][24], [NELIAC][25] and [ALGO][26]. It was also used during 1959 to publish [algorithms][27] in _[CACM][28]_, beginning a trend of using ALGOL notation in publication that continued for many years.
