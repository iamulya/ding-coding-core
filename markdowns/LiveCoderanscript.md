**LiveCode** (formerly Revolution and MetaCard[\[1\]][0]) is both an open-source and proprietary [cross-platform][1][\[2\]][2] [rapid application development][3] runtime environment inspired by [HyperCard][4]. It features the Transcript (formerly MetaTalk) programming language which belongs to the family of [xTalk][5] scripting languages like [HyperCard][4]'s [HyperTalk][6].[\[3\]][7][\[4\]][8]

The environment was introduced in 2001\.[\[5\]][9] The "Revolution" development system was based on the [MetaCard][10] engine technology which Runtime Revolution later acquired from MetaCard Corporation in 2003\.[\[6\]][11][\[7\]][12] The platform won the Macworld Annual Editor's Choice Award for "Best Development Software" in 2004\.[\[8\]][13] "Revolution" was renamed "LiveCode" in the fall of 2010\. "LiveCode" is developed and sold by Runtime Revolution Ltd., based in Edinburgh, Scotland. In March, 2015, the company was renamed "LiveCode Ltd.", to unify the company name with the product. In April 2013 a free/open source version 'LiveCode Community Edition 6.0' was published after a successful [crowdfunding][14] campaign at [Kickstarter][15].[\[9\]][16] The code base was re-licensed and made available as [free and open source software][17] with a version in April 2013\.

LiveCode runs on [iOS][18], [Android][19], [OS X][20], [Windows 95][21] through [Windows 10][22], [Raspberry Pi][23] and several variations of Unix, including Linux, Solaris, and BSD. It can be used for mobile, desktop and server/CGI applications. The iOS (iPhone and iPad) version was released in December 2010\.[\[10\]][24][\[11\]][25] The first version to deploy to the Web was released in 2009\.[\[12\]][26] It is the most widely used HyperCard/HyperTalk clone,\[_[citation needed][27]_\] and the only one that runs on all major operating systems.

A developer release of v.8 was announced in New York on March 12, 2015\. This major enhancement to the product includes a new, separate development language, known as "LiveCode Builder", which is capable of creating new object classes called "widgets". In earlier versions, the set of object classes was fixed, and could only be enhanced via the use of ordinary procedural languages like C. The new language, which runs in its own [IDE][28], is a departure from the transitional x-talk paradigm in that it permits typing of variables. But the two environments are fully integrated, and apart from the ability to create new objects, development in LiveCode proceeds in the normal way, within the established IDE.

A second [crowdfunding][14] campaign to Bring HTML5 to LiveCode reached funding goals of nearly $400,000 USD on July 31, 2014\. LiveCode developer release 8.0 DP4 (August 31, 2015) was the first to include a standalone deployment option to [HTML5][29].

## Description

The LiveCode software creates applications that run in many supported environments, using a compile-free workflow. The same computer code in LiveCode can play across multiple devices and platforms. LiveCode uses a high level, English-like programming language called Transcript that is dynamically typed. Transcript and compile-free workflow generates code that is self-documenting and easy for casual programmers to comprehend. For example, if the following script was executed when the system clock was at 9:00:00 AM:

Ten lines will be loaded into the first text field. (denoted as "field 1"), and seen as:

Notes:

LiveCode's natural English-like syntax is easy for beginners to learn. Variables are typeless, and are typed at compile time based purely on context. This makes the language simple to read and maintain, with relatively minimal loss of speed. The language contains advanced features including [associative arrays][30],[\[13\]][31] [regular expressions][32], multimedia, support for a variety of [SQL][33] databases, and [TCP/IP][34] libraries. The LiveCode engine supports several common image formats (including BMP, PNG, GIF, and JPEG,), anti-aliased vector graphics, HTML-style text hyperlinks, chained behaviors and embedded web browsers. Accessing these higher-level functions is designed to be straightforward.

## Examples

## Depth

LiveCode has around 1,900 built-in language terms and keywords, which may be extended by external libraries written in C and other lower level languages.[\[14\]][35][\[15\]][36]

## Outcomes

LiveCode project files are binary-compatible across platforms. They inherit each platform's look-and-feel and behaviors. Buttons, scroll bars, progress bars and menus behave as expected on the target platform without any intervention on the part of the one authoring a LiveCode application.

Compiling a LiveCode "standalone" produces a single, executable file (minimum size ~1.5MB) for each platform targeted. There is no separate runtime necessary.

The Wikipedia article on [HyperCard][4] contains a more detailed discussion about the basics of a similar development environment and scripting language. Modern LiveCode is a vast superset of the former [HyperCard][4] yet retains its simplicity. LiveCode includes a number of features missing from the original HyperCard program, including multiple platform deployment, communication with external devices and many fundamental language extensions. The LiveCode toolkit, as compared to HyperCard, has the ability to access internet-based text and media resources, which allows the creation of internet-enabled desktop applications.[\[16\]][37]

## Compatibility

iOS and Android targets are available in some versions.

Note: Complete Linux requirements for 4.5.x-6.x are the following:
