The **Modula** [programming language][0] is a descendent of the [Pascal programming language][1]. It was developed in [Switzerland][2] in the 1970s by [Niklaus Wirth][3], the same person who designed Pascal. The main innovation of Modula over Pascal is a [module system][4], used for grouping sets of related declarations into program units; hence the name _Modula_. The language is defined in a report by Wirth called _Modula. A language for modular multiprogramming_ published 1976\.[\[1\]][5]

Modula was first implemented by Niklaus Wirth himself on a [PDP-11][6]. Very soon other implementations followed, most important the University of York Modula compiler and a compiler developed at Philips Laboratories named PL Modula, which generated code for the LSI-11 microprocessor.

The development of Modula was discontinued soon after its publication. Wirth then concentrated his efforts on Modula's successor, [Modula-2][7].
