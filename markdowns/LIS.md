**LIS** (Language d'Implementation de Syst√®mes) was a system implementation [programming language][0] designed by [Jean Ichbiah][1], who later designed [Ada][2].

LIS was used to implement the compiler for the Ada-0 subset of Ada at Karlsruhe on the [BS2000][3] Siemens operating system.[\[1\]][4] Later on the Karlsruhe Ada compilation system got rewritten in Ada-0 itself, which was easy, because LIS and Ada-0 are very close.
