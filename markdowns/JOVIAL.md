**JOVIAL** is a [high-level computer programming language][0] similar to [ALGOL][1], but specialized for the development of [embedded systems][2] (specialized computer systems designed to perform one or a few dedicated functions, usually embedded as part of a complete device including mechanical parts).

## History

JOVIAL was developed as a new "high-order" programming language beginning in 1959 by a team at [System Development Corporation][3] (SDC) headed by [Jules Schwartz][4] to compose software for the electronics of military aircraft.[\[1\]][5] The name _JOVIAL_ is an acronym for "**J**ules **O**wn **V**ersion of the **I**nternational **A**lgebraic **L**anguage."[\[2\]][6] The "International Algorithmic Language" (IAL) was a name originally proposed for [ALGOL 58][7].

During the 1960s JOVIAL was a part of the US Military [L-project][8] series, in particular [465L][9] (the [SACCS][10] project), due to a lack of [real-time processing][11] languages available. Some 95% of the SACCS project, managed by ITT with software primarily written by SDC, was written in JOVIAL. The software project took two years and fewer than 1400 programmer years, less than half of the equivalent time in the [SAGE][12] L-project.[\[3\]][13]

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the [U.S. Air Force][14] adopted a standardized [CPU][15], the [MIL-STD-1750A][16], and subsequent JOVIAL programs were built for that processor. Several commercial vendors provided compilers and related tools to build JOVIAL for processors such as the MIL-STD-1750A, including [Advanced Computer Techniques][17] (ACT), [TLD Systems][18], [Proprietary Software Systems][19] (PSS), and others.[\[4\]][20][\[5\]][21]

JOVIAL was standardized during 1973 with MIL-STD-1589 and was revised during 1984 with **MIL-STD-1589C**. It is still much used to update and maintain software on older military vehicles and aircraft. There are three dialects in common use: J3, J3B-2, and J73\.

As of 2010, JOVIAL is no longer maintained and distributed by the USAF JOVIAL Program Office (JPO). Software previously distributed by the JPO is still available through commercial resources at [Software Engineering Associates, Inc.][22] (SEA) as are other combinations of host/target processors including [Microsoft Windows][23], [Linux][24], [Mac OS X][25] on [PowerPC][26], [SPARC][27], [VAX][28], [1750A][29], [PowerPC][26], [TI-9989][30], [Zilog Z800x][31], [Motorola 680x0][32] and [IBM System 360][33]/[System 370][34]/[System z][35]. In addition [DDC-I][36], which acquired parts of Advanced Computer Techniques, also still lists JOVIAL compilers and related tools.[\[6\]][37]

Most software implemented in JOVIAL is [mission critical][38], and maintenance is getting more difficult. In December 2014 it was incorrectly reported that software deriving from JOVIAL code produced in the 1960s was involved in a major failure of the [United Kingdom][39]'s [air traffic control][40] infrastructure, and that [the agency which uses it][41] was having to train its IT staff in JOVIAL in order to maintain this software, which is not scheduled for replacement until 2016\.[\[7\]][42] Conversion of JOVIAL code to new platforms is therefore becoming more common. JOVIAL rehosting and retargeting is currently done by Software Engineering Associates. Conversions of JOVIAL to other languages is currently done by Semantic Designs, whose [DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit][43] was used to convert some of the JOVIAL mission software for the [B-2 bomber][44] to [C][45].[\[8\]][46]

## Influence

According to Schwartz languages influenced by JOVIAL include [CORAL][47], [SYMPL][48], [Space Programming Language][49] (SPL), and to some extent [CMS-2][50].[\[9\]][51] An [interactive][52] subset of JOVIAL called TINT, similar to [JOSS][53] was developed in the 1960s.[\[2\]][6]

## Features

JOVIAL includes features not found in standard ALGOL, such as [records][54], [arrays][55] of records, and [inline assembly language][56].[\[10\]][57]

## Applications

Notable systems using JOVIAL include:

Airborne [radar][58] systems with embedded JOVIAL software include the [APG-70][59], [APG-71][60] and [APG-73][61].[\[12\]][62]
