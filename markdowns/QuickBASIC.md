**Microsoft QuickBASIC** (also **QB**) is an [Integrated Development Environment][0] (or IDE) and [compiler][1] for the [BASIC][2] [programming language][3] that was developed by [Microsoft][4]. QuickBASIC runs mainly on [DOS][5], though there was a short-lived version for the [classic Mac OS][6]. It is loosely based on [GW-BASIC][7] but adds user-defined types, improved programming structures, better graphics and disk support and a compiler in addition to the [interpreter][8]. Microsoft marketed QuickBASIC as the introductory level for their BASIC Professional Development System.[\[1\]][9] Microsoft marketed two other similar IDEs for C and Pascal, viz [QuickC][10] and [QuickPascal][11].

## History

Microsoft released the first version of QuickBASIC on August 18, 1985 on a single 5.25" 360kB [floppy disk][12]. QuickBASIC version 2.0 and later contained an [Integrated Development Environment][0] (IDE), allowing users to edit directly in its on-screen text editor.

Although still supported in QuickBASIC, line numbers became optional. Program jumps also worked with named labels. Later versions also added control structures, such as multiline [conditional statements][13] and loop blocks.

Microsoft's "PC BASIC Compiler" was included for compiling programs into DOS executables. Beginning with version 4.0, the editor included an interpreter that allowed the programmer to run the program without leaving the editor. The interpreter was used to debug a program before creating an executable file. Unfortunately, there were some subtle differences between the interpreter and the compiler, which meant that large programs that ran correctly in the interpreter might fail after compilation, or not compile at all because of differences in the memory management routines.[\[2\]][14]

The last version of QuickBASIC was version 4.5 (1988), although development of the [Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System][15] (PDS) continued until its last release of version 7.1 in October 1990\.[\[3\]][16] At the same time, the QuickBASIC packaging was silently changed so that the disks used the same compression used for BASIC PDS 7.1\.[\[4\]][17] The Basic PDS 7.x version of the IDE was called QuickBASIC Extended (QBX), and it only ran on DOS, unlike the rest of Basic PDS 7.x, which also ran on OS/2\. The successor to QuickBASIC and Basic PDS was [Visual Basic][18] for MS-DOS 1.0, shipped in Standard and Professional versions. Later versions of Visual Basic did not include DOS versions, as Microsoft concentrated on Windows applications.

A subset of QuickBASIC 4.5, named [QBasic][19], was included with [MS-DOS][20] 5 and later versions, replacing the [GW-BASIC][7] included with previous versions of MS-DOS. Compared to QuickBASIC, QBasic is limited to an interpreter only, lacks a few functions, can only handle programs of a limited size, and lacks support for separate program modules. Since it lacks a compiler, it cannot be used to produce executable files, although its program source code can still be compiled by a QuickBASIC 4.5, PDS 7.x or VBDOS 1.0 compiler, if available.

QuickBASIC 1.00 for the [Apple Macintosh][21] operating system was launched in 1988\. It was officially supported on machines running [System 6][22] with at least 1 MB of RAM.[\[5\]][23] QuickBASIC could also be run on [System 7][24], as long as 32-bit addressing was disabled; this was not possible on [Motorola 68040][25]-based Macintosh machines.

## Current uses

QuickBASIC continues to be used in some schools, usually as part of an introduction to programming\[_[citation needed][27]_\], though it is fast becoming replaced by more popular compilers. It also has an unofficial community of hobby programmers who use the compiler to write [video games][28], [GUIs][29] and [utilities][30].[\[6\]][31][\[7\]][32][\[8\]][33] The community has dedicated several Web sites, [message boards][34] and [online magazines][35] to the language.[\[9\]][36][\[10\]][37]

Today, programmers sometimes use DOS [emulators][38], such as [DOSBox][39], to run QuickBASIC on [Linux][40] and on modern [personal computer hardware][41] that no longer supports the compiler.[\[11\]][42][\[12\]][43] One alternative to this is [FreeBASIC][44], but it cannot yet run _all_ QBasic/QuickBASIC programs.[\[13\]][45]

Since 2008, a set of [TCP/IP][46] routines for QuickBASIC 4.x and 7.1 has revitalized some interest in the software. In particular, the [vintage computer][47] hobbyist community has been able to write software for old computers that run DOS, allowing these machines to access other computers through a [LAN][48] or the internet. This has allowed systems even as old as an [8088][49] to serve new functions, such as acting as a [Web server][50] or using [IRC][51].[\[14\]][52]

## Successors

Microsoft's [Visual Basic][18] was the successor of QuickBASIC. Other compilers, like [PowerBASIC][53] and [FreeBASIC][44], have varying degrees of compatibility. [QB64][54], a [multiplatform][55] QuickBASIC compiler, is developed and is 100% compatible.[\[15\]][56]
