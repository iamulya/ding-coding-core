**I** ([named][0] _i_ [/ˈaɪ/][1], plural _ies_)[\[1\]][2] is the ninth [letter][3] and the third [vowel][4] in the [ISO basic Latin alphabet][5].

## History

In the [Phoenician alphabet][6], the letter may have originated in a [hieroglyph][7] for an arm that represented a [voiced pharyngeal fricative][8] (/ʕ/) in [Egyptian][9], but was reassigned to /j/ (as in English "**y**es") by Semites, because their word for "arm" began with that sound. This letter could also be used to represent /i/, the [close front unrounded vowel][10], mainly in foreign words.

The Greeks adopted a form of this [Phoenician][6] _yodh_ as their letter _[iota][11]_ (⟨Ι, ι⟩) to represent /i/, the same as in the [Old Italic alphabet][12]. In Latin (as in Modern Greek), it was also used to represent /j/ and this use persists in the languages that descended from Latin. The modern letter '[j][13]' originated as a variation of 'i', and both were used interchangeably for both the vowel and the consonant, coming to be differentiated only in the 16th century.[\[2\]][14] The dot over the lowercase 'i' is sometimes called a _[tittle][15]_. In the [Turkish alphabet][16], [dotted and dotless I][17] are considered separate letters, representing a front and back vowel, respectively, and both have uppercase ('I', '[İ][17]') and lowercase ('ı', 'i') forms.

## Use in writing systems

## English

In [Modern English][18] [spelling][19], ⟨i⟩ represents several different sounds, either the diphthong [/aɪ/][1] ("long" ⟨i⟩) as in _kite_, the short [/ɪ/][1] as in _bill_, or the ⟨ee⟩ sound [/iː/][1] in the last syllable of _machine_. The diphthong /aɪ/ developed from [Middle English][20] /iː/ through a series of vowel shifts. In the [Great Vowel Shift][21], Middle English /iː/ changed to [Early Modern English][22] /ei/, which later changed to /əi/ and finally to the Modern English diphthong /aɪ/ in [General American][23] and [Received Pronunciation][24]. Because the diphthong /aɪ/ developed from a Middle English long vowel, it is called "long" ⟨i⟩ in traditional English grammar.\[_[citation needed][25]_\]

The letter ⟨i⟩ is the fifth most common letter in the [English language][26].[\[3\]][27]

The English first-person singular nominative pronoun is "I", pronounced [/aɪ/][1] and always written with a capital letter. This pattern arose for basically the same reason that lowercase ⟨i⟩ acquired a dot: so it wouldn't get lost in manuscripts before the age of printing:

The capitalized "I" first showed up about 1250 in the northern and midland dialects of England, according to the _Chambers Dictionary of Etymology_.

_Chambers_ notes, however, that the capitalized form didn't become established in the south of England "until the 1700s (although it appears sporadically before that time).

Capitalizing the pronoun, _Chambers_ explains, made it more distinct, thus "avoiding misreading handwritten manuscripts."[\[4\]][28]

## Other languages

In many languages' orthographies, ⟨i⟩ is used to represent the sound /i/ or, more rarely, /ɪ/.

## Other uses

The [Roman numeral][29] Ⅰ represents the number [1][30].[\[5\]][31][\[6\]][32]

## Forms and variants

In some [sans serif][33] [typefaces][34], the uppercase letter I, 'I' may be difficult to distinguish from the lowercase [letter L][35], 'l', the [vertical bar character][36] '|', or the [digit one][30] '1'. In serifed typefaces, the capital form of the letter has both a baseline and a cap-height serif, while the lowercase L has generally a hooked ascender and a baseline serif.

The uppercase I does not have a dot ([tittle][15]) while the lowercase i has one in most Latin-derived alphabets. However, some schemes, such as the [Turkish alphabet][16], have two kinds of I: [dotted (İi) and dotless (Iı)][17].

The uppercase I has two kinds of shapes, with serifs ([![I with crossbars.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/I_with_crossbars.svg/6px-I_with_crossbars.svg.png)][37]) and without serifs ([![I without crossbars.svg](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5f/I_without_crossbars.svg/2px-I_without_crossbars.svg.png)][38]). Usually these are considered equivalent, but they are distinguished in some extended Latin alphabet systems such as the [1978 version of the African reference alphabet][39]. In that system, the former is the uppercase counterpart of [ɪ][40] and the latter is the counterpart of 'i'.
